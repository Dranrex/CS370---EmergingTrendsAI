# CS370---EmergingTrendsAI

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

    I was given starter code that laid out the basic operations of the maze and how the score was counted. I had to create the Q-Learning algorithm for agent training so that it could improve its score over time.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

    AI is an emerging field that is sure to overtake the world in various aspects. It's better to adopt new ideas than to refuse them and get left behind on up and coming knowledge and practices. As AI continues to grow, so too will demands for those who understand it.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

    In respect to AI, they create and design the model and how it will function. In the past year an explosive emergence has happened of basic LLMs that have proved to be entertaining, informative, but still very crude in its early design. Computer Scientists are creating the future and computers can do more than humans ever could, faster and more efficiently.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

    By continually asking how and why, it is my responsibility to learn how these systems operate and stay curious in my endeavors to help solve humanity's problems. People rely on computer science to streamline tedious tasks and simplify complicated problems. Computers solve the many needs that people have to make their lives easier.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
